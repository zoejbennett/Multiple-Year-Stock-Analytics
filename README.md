## Stock Analysis

This analysis illustrates the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume of a set of 3000 stocks between 2018 and 2020. 
Conditional formatting is applied to the "Percent change" column to highlight stock increases in green and decreases in red. 
Finally, the tickers with the greatest percent increase, decrease, and total volume of the dataset are included as well. 

Throughout the written code, I utilized help from my class slack channel, instructor Kevin Lee, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT to debug errors as I encountered them.
